> **Build/Run Requirements:**
> 
> - Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition (or higher) 
> - A local instance of IIS installed.
> - To build the current release version use the release branch: https://github.com/webprofusion/certify/tree/release, master is the current work in progress.
> - To build, first build the submodule for ACMESharp under /src/lib/ACMESharp - this will restore the required nuget packages.
> - The app needs to run as Administrator, otherwise it cannot access IIS, write to the IIS website root paths or manage the windows certificate store.

> **Note:**  For testing you will require a publicly accessible IP mapped to the domain/subdomain you want to test with. The Let's Encrypt service will need to be able to access your test site remotely via HTTP in order to complete authorisation challenges.
